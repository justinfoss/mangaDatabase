## MangaUpdates Public Lists to Database

### Why?
Have you ever wanted to move your MangaUpdates manga list to somewhere else easily? Ever wanted to use that manga list in other projects but didn't want to constantly download the json file? Well I have the solution for you! With just a few clicks and clacks, your manga list will be put into SQL form! Allowing you to use it in any sort of projects, including but not limited to, discord bot.

### Will This be Updated Ever?
Probally. This was originally used with my discord bot, so main.py doesn't actually use the update from mangaupdates parts. But I will be fixing that soon.
